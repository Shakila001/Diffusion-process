1. Implement the following models in the language of your preference:
• Random graph
• Watts-Strogatz model
• Barabasi-Albert model
Set the number of nodes to N = 2000, simulate the models for various
settings of the parameters and save the graphs. You may use graph data
structures provided by the existing network libraries or your own class to
store the graphs. For each graph:
• Report the number of vertices and edges
• Compute the average degree and the variance of the degree distribution
• Generate the frequency plot for the degrees of the nodes
• Fit a model distribution to the obtained data. In case of the BarabasiAlbert graph, you may have a look at https://aaronclauset.github.
